<p>I am Yixian Chen. I am currently a senior undergraduate student in <a class="tosu" href="http://astro.pku.edu.cn ">Department of Astronomy,</a> <a class="tosu" href="http://pku.edu.cn">Peking University. </a>
<br>
<br> 
I'm interested in a variety of topics in astronomy and astrophysics, such as galaxy formation and evolution, low surface brightness astrophysics, cosmology, deep sky surveys, supernova, data science and astronomical instrumentation. Currently I'm working with the data from cutting-edge deep sky surveys (such as <a href="https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp">Hyper Suprime-Camera (HSC)</a>  and <a href="http://dragonflytelescope.org">Dragonfly</a>) to study low surface brightness objects in our Universe. I also had experience on studying galaxy quenching mechanism utilizing <a href="https://www.sdss.org/dr14/manga/">MaNGA IFU</a> data. In the future, I'm eager to develop expertise on various topics of galaxy and cosmology.

On my homepage, you can find more than my research. I'm a big fan of any kind of music, from Indian Sitar to Chopin and Rachmaninoff. I became an amateur astronomer since I was in sixth grade in primary school. I also took photos for a variety of objects, not only in the sky but also around myself. Check some of my collection here: <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/art/"><strong>Art</strong></a>!

I was born in <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/定西市">Dingxi</a>, Gansu, which is a small city in northwest China. Sichuan dishes often appear on my table. Check my dishes in <a href="https://astrojacobli.github.io//miscellany/cooking/"><strong>Cooking</strong> </a>.
