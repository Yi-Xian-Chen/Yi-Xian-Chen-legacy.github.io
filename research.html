  <h3>Star Formation & Evolution in AGN Disks</h3>
  <p> Gravitational instability (GI) occurs in accretion disks where it's cold and density is compact.
    This mechanism is thought to form gas giants in the outskits of protoplanetary disks (Boss 1997) and stars in outskits of AGN disks.
    Previous studies use Newtonian cooling, criterion
    We perform 3D radiation hydrodynamic simulations to show that even at longer cooling times, fragmentation can occur when the disk is radiation pressure dominated, 
    therefore the formation is easier. 
    When the cooling timescale is short, the typical fragment mass can be very different than expected due to rapid diffusion (can no longer support gas as an adiabatic fluid). 
   </p>
  <p> 
    Accretion is different. Separate different regimes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether or not it is immortal. Nevertheless, this can be reflected in one key parameter for disk modeling.

    <h3>Accretion & Migration of Gap-opening Companions </h3>
    <p> In the context of classical companion-disc interaction theory, we evolve a companion planet/star/black hole 
        embedded in a laminar, locally isothermal
        accretion disk surrounding the host star/SMBH, adding viscosity to mimick the effect of turbulent advection/diffusion. 
        A massive companion can carve a gap in the surface density profile of the disk close to its vicinity, 
        while the perturbed density profile determines the migration torque. 
        Although this density depletion factor can be calculated self-consistently if the gap is relatively wide and flat (Kanagawa+ 2018), 
        we show in <a class = "tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900...44C/abstract"> this paper </a> that this estimation could break down if
        the gap is steep enough for very massive companions, 
        in which case only a few low-order Lindblad resonances at the gap edges contribute effectively to the total migration torque. 
        In conclusion, the intrinsic surface density slope of the disk delicately determines 
        both the pace and direction of very massive planets' type II migration.</li>

        In another series of papers, we conduct <a class = "tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...906...52L/abstract"> 2D </a> and <a class = "tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.526.5346L/abstract"> 3D </a> simulations of gas giants on fixed orbits to measure their accretion rates, 
        deriving simple scaling relations that depend on the mass ratio and disk parameters. 
        We highlight that, across a wide parameter space and with appropriate inner boundary conditions, 
        the planet's accretion rate is often capped by the outer disk's accretion rate, 
        while the inner disk becomes depleted on a viscous timescale. We also find that a the eccentricity of the disk requires much larger companion mass to excite in 3D compared to 2D. 
        Additionally, in our investigation of the <a class = "tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...971..130L/abstract"> concurrent accretion and migration of gas giants </a>, 
        we emphasize the significance of accretion torque, 
        demonstrating that gas giants can migrate outward under certain conditions of high viscosity.

    <h3>"Unorthodox" Companion-Disk Interactions</h3>
    <p> In extreme AGN environments and specific regimes of protoplanetary disks, 
      the traditional picture of a laminar disk with a circular companion may not be complete. 
      In a series of studies, we explored several unconventional factors that could significantly influence 
      conclusions about companion-disk interactions.
    <ul><li>
      <b>Eccentricity</b>: In the classical picture, the circum-companion disk spin is prograde with respect to the global angular momentum. 
      However, this is not trivial since the Keplerian shear background of the disk is retrograde, and steady tidal perturbation is required
      to twist that background into the classical circum-companion flow within a few orbital timescales.
      We used <a class = "tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...928L...1L/abstract"> 2D </a> and 
      <a class = "tsou", href ="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...939L..23C/abstract"> 3D, adaptive mesh refinement </a> simulations 
      to show that when the companion is eccentric enough, 
      the epicyclic motion could disrupt steady tidal perturbation,
      and establish a retrograde circum-companion disk. 
      This finding has implications for the spin evolution of AGN-embedded black holes and in-situ formation of retrograde satellites.

      <p class='text-center'><em> Flow pattern around the companion at larger and larger orbital eccentricities. Color indicates specific angular momentum, red=prograde and blue=retrograde. </em></p>
    <li>
      <b>Turbulence</b>: We show in <a class = "tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.522..319C/abstract"> this study </a> that 
      strong turbulence can also disrupt the prograde circum-companion flow, and cause stochastic spin accretion of the companion.
      On average, this effect tends to reduce the magnitude/dispersion of AGN-embedded Black Holes' spin towards a small residue value, consistent with LIGO-VIRGO measurements.
      We also find that it could lead to  <a class = "tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.528L.127W/abstract"> chaotic Type I migration </a>.

      <p class='text-center'><em> Flow pattern around the companion at larger and larger turbulent levels.  </em></p>

    <li>
      <b>Wind</b>: Recent observations indicate that in the MRI-dead zone of protoplanetary disks, 
      accretion may be driven by MHD winds instead of turbulence. 
      Detailed 3D non-ideal MHD simulations (e.g., Aoyama & Bai 2023) suggest that strong advection of material across a planet-induced gap, in a windy disk,
      could disrupt classical horseshoe flows and influence corotation torque. 
      By incorporating phenomenological models that capture basic dynamical effects of disk winds 
      into cost-effective 2D hydrodynamic simulations, 
      we perform parameter surveys to examine the dependence of migration torque on accretion parameters in windy disks (paper in prep).
    </li>
    <li>
      We also try to look at global signatures of these iteractions that could potentially 
      manifest in ALMA images of substructured protoplanetary disks.
      E.g. eccentric planets, 
      due to their radial excursion, can produce <a class ="tsou", href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...922..184C/abstract"> relatively wide gaps in the dust profile </a>, 
      complicating the inference of planet mass from gap widths; 
      In windy discs, we find that radial advection of materials enhances Rossby Wave Instability at the gap outer edges, 
      leading to <a class="tsou", href ="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.523.2630W/abstract"> 
      amplified asymmetries in the dust distribution </a>, 
      counteracting the effects of viscosity. 
      We plan to observe a particular source DM Tau during ALMA Cycle 11 to determine whether the asymmetry of this system is associated with disk winds.

            <h3> Preservation of Super-earths from Runaway Accretion </h3> 
              <p> In <a class = "tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...896..135C/abstract"> my first paper</a>, 
               we investigate the effect of pebble isolation on the cooling process of 
               rocky planet cores, before the quasi-steady (thermal) accretion could grow a gas envelope more massive than the core itself and trigger
               dynamical (runaway) accretion, the latter of which is relevant to fore-mentioned hydrodynamical simulations. 
               We find that as pebbles are trapped in the pressure bump outside the planet core's orbit, they collide to
               produce small dust that enhances the opacity in the planet's vicinity. 
               This process will effectly prolong the core's cooling process and preserve super-Earths within a few au of the star, 
               while at larger orbital radii, cooling of the core can still be efficient enough to trigger runaway accretion, 
               forming gas giants.
               This dichotomy is consistent with the inner super-Earth, 
               outer gas giant general picture of exoplanet architecture statistics.

    <h3>Dust Accumulation at the Magnetospheric Truncation Radius of Protoplanetary Disks</h3>
    <p> In <a class="tsou" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.5246L/abstract"> Paper I</a>, we explored the possibility of dust being trapped at the global pressure and density maxima of the disk, 
        specifically at the inner magnetospheric truncation radius, Rt. Within a limited parameter space where the temperature at Rt
        is moderate—sufficiently high to allow magnetic coupling but low enough to prevent dust sublimation—
        two planetesimal formation channels emerge: 
        (i) Breakthough scenario: individual dust particles can coagulate and grow beyond the fragmentation threshold, or 
        (ii) GI scenatio: small dust particles can accumulate until their concentration exceeds unity, 
        triggering strong gravitational instabilities that lead to planetesimal formation. 
        In <a class="tsou" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.529..893L/abstract"> Paper II</a>, we found that thermal feedback due to the correlation between opacity and concentration of small dust, 
        tends to suppress scenario (ii).  These planetesimals may eventually form ultra-short-periodic Vulcan planets. </p>

    <h3>Atmosphere Boundary Conditions for Giant Planet Post-formation Evolution</h3>
    <p> We updated the <a class = "tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...957...36C/abstract"> atmospheric boundary condition</a> tables for gas giants to include treatments for cloud formation and irradiation. 
      Each grid point in these tables represents a plane-parallel solution of multi-frequency radiative transfer equations, 
      which describe the temperature-pressure profile and, notably, the internal entropy at the base of the atmosphere, 
      given the planet's internal effective temperature and surface gravity. 
      My collaborators have developed <a class="tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...971..104S/abstract"> APPLE</a>, 
      that utilizes these tables to study the post-formation cooling of gas giants towards the present epoch. 
      APPLE functions similarly to stellar evolution codes like MESA but includes updated treatments of the 
      equation of state, convection, and helium rain, making it more suitable for studying Jupiter and Saturn-like exoplanets.
