    <h3>Accretion & Migration of Gap-opening Planets </h3>
    <p> In the context of classical companion-disc interaction theory, we evolve a planet/embedded star with 
        an extremely small mass ratio embedded in a laminar
        accretion disk surrounding the host star/SMBH, adding viscosity to mimick the effect of turbulent advection/diffusion. 
        A massive companion can carve a gap in the surface density profile of the disk close to its vicinity, 
        while the perturbed density profile determines the migration torque. 
        Although this density depletion factor can be calculated self-consistently if the gap is relatively wide and flat (Kanagawa+ 2018), 
        we show in <a class = "tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...900...44C/abstract"> this paper </a> that this estimation could break down if
        the gap is steep enough for very massive companions, 
        in which case only a few low-order Lindblad resonances at the gap edges contribute effective to the total migration torque. 
        In conclusion, the intrinsic surface density slope of the disk delicately determines 
        both the pace and direction of very massive planets' type II migration.</li>

        In another series of papers, we conduct <a class = "tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...906...52L/abstract"> 2D </a> and <a class = "tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.526.5346L/abstract"> 3D </a> simulations of gas giants on fixed orbits to measure their accretion rates, 
        deriving simple scaling relations that depend on the mass ratio and disk parameters. 
        We highlight that, across a wide parameter space and with appropriate inner boundary conditions, 
        the planet's accretion rate is often capped by the outer disk's accretion rate, 
        while the inner disk becomes depleted on a viscous timescale. We also find that a the eccentricity of the disk requires much larger companion mass to excite in 3D compared to 2D. 
        Additionally, in our investigation of the <a class = "tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...971..130L/abstract"> concurrent accretion and migration of gas giants </a>, 
        we emphasize the significance of accretion torque, 
        demonstrating that gas giants can migrate outward under conditions of high viscosity.

            <h3> Preservation of Super-earths from Runaway Accretion </h3> 
              <p> In <a class = "tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...896..135C/abstract"> my first paper </a>, 
               we investigate the effect of pebble isolation on the cooling process of 
               rocky planet cores, before the quasi-steady (thermal) accretion could grow a gas envelope more massive than the core itself and trigger
               dynamical (runaway) accretion, the latter of which is relevant to fore-mentioned hydrodynamical simulations. 
               We find that as pebbles are trapped in the pressure bump outside the planet core's orbit, they collide to
               produce small dust that enhances the opacity in the planet's vicinity. 
               This process will effectly prolong the core's cooling process and preserve super-Earths within a few au of the star, 
               while at larger orbital radii, cooling of the core can still be efficient enough to trigger runaway accretion, 
               forming gas giants.
               This dichotomy is consistent with the inner super-Earth, 
               outer gas giant general picture of exoplanet architecture statistics.

    <h3>Atmosphere Boundary Conditions for Giant Planet Post-formation Evolution</h3>
    <p> We updated the <a class = "tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...957...36C/abstract"> atmospheric boundary condition </a> tables for gas giants to include treatments for cloud formation and irradiation. 
      Each grid point in these tables represents a plane-parallel solution of multi-frequency radiative transfer equations, 
      which describe the temperature-pressure profile and, notably, the internal entropy at the base of the atmosphere, 
      given the planet's internal effective temperature and surface gravity. 
      My collaborators have developed <a class="tsou", href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...971..104S/abstract"> APPLE </a>, 
      that utilizes these tables to study the post-formation cooling of gas giants towards the present epoch. 
      APPLE functions similarly to stellar evolution codes like MESA but includes updated treatments of the 
      equation of state, convection, and helium rain, making it more suitable for studying Jupiter and Saturn-like exoplanets.

    <h3>Dust Accumulation at the Magnetospheric Truncation Radius of PPDs</h3>
    <p> In <a class="tsou" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.510.5246L/abstract"> Paper I </a>, we explored the possibility of dust being trapped at the global pressure and density maxima of the disk, 
        specifically at the inner magnetospheric truncation radius, Rt. Within a limited parameter space where the temperature at Rt
        is moderate—sufficiently high to allow magnetic coupling but low enough to prevent dust sublimation—
        two planetesimal formation channels emerge: 
        (i) Breakthough scenario: individual dust particles can coagulate and grow beyond the fragmentation threshold, or 
        (ii) GI scenatio: small dust particles can accumulate until their concentration exceeds unity, 
        triggering strong gravitational instabilities that lead to planetesimal formation. 
        In <a class="tsou" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024MNRAS.529..893L/abstract"> Paper II </a>, we found that thermal feedback due to the correlation between opacity and concentration of small dust, 
        tends to suppress scenario (ii).  These planetesimals may eventually form ultra-short-periodic Vulcan planets. </p>
